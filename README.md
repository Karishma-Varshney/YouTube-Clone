## Overview


Welcome to the Youtube Clone project! 

This project is a clone of YouTube's main page, created using only HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project is to replicate the layout and design of YouTube, focusing on the visual aspects without any backend functionality.

## Features

**Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Navigation Bar**: A fully styled navigation bar similar to YouTube's, including a search bar, logo, and user profile icon.

**Video Thumbnails**: Display of video thumbnails with titles, view counts, and upload times, mimicking YouTube's video grid layout.

**Sidebar**: A sidebar with links to different sections, such as Home, Trending, Subscriptions, Library, and History.
 


## Technology Used

**HTML5**: For the basic structure of the page.


**CSS3**: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.
